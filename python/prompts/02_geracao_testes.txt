GENERATE COMPREHENSIVE UNIT TESTS

As a senior software engineer, create a complete pytest test suite for the Gilded Rose.
Requirements:
1. Achieve 100% code coverage
2. Test ALL business rules explicitly
3. Use Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
4. Include edge cases
5. Tests should be independent
6. Use descriptive test names
7. Save as "test_gilded_rose_ai.py"

Important business rules to cover:
- "Aged Brie" increases in quality as it ages
- "Sulfuras" never decreases in quality or sell_in
- "Backstage passes" have special quality increases
- Once sell_in < 0, quality degrades twice as fast
- Quality is always between 0 and 50

Generate the complete test file with at least 30 test cases.
